Initially, there is a Robot at position (0, 0). Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot makes a circle, which means it moves back to the original place.

The move sequence is represented by a string. And each move is represent by a character. The valid robot moves are R (Right), L (Left), U (Up) and D (down). The output should be true or false representing whether the robot makes a circle.

Example 1:
```
Input: "UD"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "LL"
Output: false
```

        return (moves.count('U') == moves.count('D')) and (moves.count('L') == moves.count('R'))
```

        left = 0
        right = 0
        up = 0
        down = 0
        for step in moves:
            if step == 'U':
                up += 1
            elif step == 'D':
                down += 1
            elif step == 'L':
                left += 1
            elif step == 'R':
                right += 1
        if left - right != 0:
            return False
        if up - down != 0:
            return False
        return True
```

Discussion:
>It seems that str.count(c) is faster than the operation '+='.
