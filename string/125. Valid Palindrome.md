Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

For example,
* "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
* "race a car" is not a palindrome.

Note:

* Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
* For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if len(s) < 2:
            return True
        puncs = string.punctuation 
        for c in puncs:
            s = s.replace(c,'')
        s = s.replace(' ','')
        s = s.lower()
        return s == s[::-1]
```
