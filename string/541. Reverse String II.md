Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```
Restrictions:
1. The string consists of lower English letters only.
2. Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]

```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseStr(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        result = ''
        flag = True
        for i in range(len(s) / k+1):
            if flag:
                result += s[i*k:(i+1)*k][::-1]
            else:
                result += s[i*k:(i+1)*k]
            flag = not flag
        return result
```

        result = ''
        i = 0
        while i <= (len(s) / k)+1:
                result += s[i*k:(i+1)*k][::-1] + s[(i+1)*k:(i+2)*k]
                i += 2
        return result
