Given an integer array, find three numbers whose product is maximum and output the maximum product.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [1,2,3,4]
Output: 24
```
Note:
* The length of the given array will be in range [3,104] and all elements are in the range [-1000, 1000].
* Multiplication of any three numbers in the input won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer.

# Solution(python)
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maximumProduct(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        """
        1. size of array is in range[3,10**4], all elements are in the range[-1000,1000]
        2. multiplication of any three numbers won't exceed the range of 32-bit signed integer
        
        1. sort the array in the descending order: 
            -> first three elements are the biggest positive numbers 
            -> last three elements are the biggest negative numbers
        2. negative * negative = positive

        max1,max2,max3 = -1001,-1001,-1001
        min1,min2 = 1001,1001
        for n in nums:
            if n > max1:
                max3 = max2
                max2 = max1
                max1 = n
            elif n > max2:
                max3 = max2
