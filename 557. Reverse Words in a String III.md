Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Example 1:
```
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```
Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

# Solution(python, 39ms)
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverseWords(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # 1. split the string with space
        strlist = s.split(' ')
        # 2. reverse each word
        result = []
        for item in strlist:
            result.append(item[::-1])
        return ' '.join(result)
```
