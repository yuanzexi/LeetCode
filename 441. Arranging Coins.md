You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:
```
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```
Example 2:
```
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        """
        (1+2+...+n)= s  --> (n+1)*n / 2 = s  --> (n+1/2) = sqrt(2s+1/4)
        """
        return int(math.sqrt(2*n+0.25) - 0.5)
